The molecule_test.html has been edited to produce the file gpawdata.in

readgpawdata.f90 is compiled with "gfortran readgpawdata.f90". The
executable a.out reads gpawdata.in and produces 
  (1) a file dataout.dat, a refined table with the molid's used 
      in the bin/g2_analyze.f90
  (2) a file dataout.f90, which is a stump for including the data 
      into a fortran code

Reconstruct dataout.* with "gfortran readgpawdata.f90; a.out"
